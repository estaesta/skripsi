  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been the golden standard for the detection of cardiovascular disease for many years. Any electrical impulse disruption that causes the heart to the contract may lead to arrhythmia. Arrhythmia patients have no indications of having an arrhythmia, but a doctor may recognize arrhythmias in a routine test. Therefore, continuous wearable personal monitoring system plays a big role, and it's become popular day by day. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system, Long Short-Term Memories neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, TensorFlow and Keras library are applied here. Those deep learning models and algorithms help to achieve overall 97.57\% accuracy on arrhythmia prediction. The system is being designed with Raspberry pi 3, Arduino UNO, AD8232 single lead ECG sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth, biomedical sensor pad and battery. This system will make easier for doctors to monitor the ECG of their patients outside the hospital and also help for remote ECG monitoring. The total components cost of this research work is around USD 58.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives . The electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to diagnose a variety of arrhythmias. Generally, the abnormalities of ECG signals mainly consist of ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies and irregular intervals. The ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies represent morphological information, while the irregular intervals denote the temporal information of ECG signals. But it is difficult to utilize morphological information and temporal information simultaneously when dealing with single ECG heartbeats, because RR interval is not contained in a single short heartbeat. Therefore, to handle this problems, a novel Multi-information Fusion Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (MF-CBRNN) is proposed for arrhythmia automatic detection. Methods . The MF-CBRNN is designed with two parallel hybrid branches that can simultaneously focus on the beat-based information in the ECG beats and the segment-based information in the adjacent segments of the beats. A single ECG beat provides the morphological information. At the same time, the adjacent segment of the ECG beat enriches the temporal information, so the two branches are designed to exploit the multiple information contained in ECGs. Furthermore, a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short memory (BLSTM) in each branch is utilized to capture the information from the two inputs. And all the features extracted from the two branches are fused for information aggregation. Results . To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the ECG signals from MIT-BIH databases are used for intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms. The proposed model yields an accuracy of 99.56\% and an F1-score of 96.40\% under the intra-patient paradigm. And it obtains an overall accuracy of 96.77\% and F1-score of 77.83\% under the inter-patient paradigm. Conclusions . Compared with other studies on arrhythmia detection, our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. It indicates that the proposed model is a promising arrhythmia detection algorithm for computer-aided diagnostic systems.},

A simple approach, based on the generally false assumption that the data are generated by a random walk, is nearly optimal.

  abstract = {An automatic system for heart arrhythmia classification can perform a substantial role in managing and treating cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a deep learning-based multi-model system is proposed for the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Two different deep learning bagging models are introduced to classify heartbeats into different arrhythmias types. The first model (CNN-LSTM) is based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture local features and temporal dynamics in the ECG data. The second model (RRHOS-LSTM) integrates some classical features, i.e. RR intervals and higher-order statistics (HOS), with LSTM model to effectively highlight abnormality heartbeats classes. We create a bagging model from the CNN-LSTM and RRHOS-LSTM networks by training each model on a different sub-sampling dataset to handle the high imbalance distribution of arrhythmias classes in the ECG data. Each model is also trained using a weighted loss function to provide high weight for not sufficiently represented classes. These models are then combined using a meta-classifier to form a strong coherent model. The meta-classifier is a feedforward fully connected neural network that takes the different predictions of bagging models as an input and combines them into a final prediction. The result of the meta-classifier is then verified by another CNN-LSTM model to decrease the false positive of the overall system. The experimental results are acquired by evaluating the proposed method on ECG data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 95.81\% in the ``subject-oriented'' patient independent evaluation scheme. The averages of F1 score and positive predictive value are higher than all other methods by more than 3\% and 8\% respectively. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method for ECG heartbeats classification compared to many state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The most important ECG marker for the diagnosis of ischemia or infarction is a change in the ST segment. Baseline wander is a typical artifact that corrupts the recorded ECG and can hinder the correct diagnosis of such diseases. For the purpose of finding the best suited filter for the removal of baseline wander, the ground truth about the ST change prior to the corrupting artifact and the subsequent filtering process is needed. In order to create the desired reference, we used a large simulation study that allowed us to represent the ischemic heart at a multiscale level from the cardiac myocyte to the surface ECG. We also created a realistic model of baseline wander to evaluate five filtering techniques commonly used in literature. In the simulation study, we included a total of 5.5 million signals coming from 765 electrophysiological setups. We found that the best performing method was the wavelet-based baseline cancellation. However, for medical applications, the Butterworth high-pass filter is the better choice because it is computationally cheap and almost as accurate. Even though all methods modify the ST segment up to some extent, they were all proved to be better than leaving baseline wander unfiltered.}

The method relies on the time intervals between consequent beats and their morphology for the ECG characterisation. Different descriptors based on wavelets, local binary patterns (LBP), higher order statistics (HOS) and several amplitude values were employed. Instead of concatenating all these features to feed a single SVM model, we propose to train specific SVM models for each type of feature. In order to obtain the final prediction, the decisions of the different models are combined with the product, sum, and majority rules. The designed methodology approaches are tested on the public MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, classifying four kinds of abnormal and normal beats. Our approach based on an ensemble of SVMs offered a satisfactory performance, improving the results when compared to a single SVM model using the same features. Additionally, our approach also showed better results in comparison with previous machine learning approaches of the state-of-the-art.},

When using a traditional monitoring system, an abnormal heartbeat may not appear during a recording in a healthcare facility due to the limited time. Thus, continuous and long-term monitoring is needed. Moreover, the conventional equipment may not be portable and cannot be used at arbitrary times and locations. A wearable sensor device such as Polar H10 offers the same capability as an alternative. It has gold-standard heartbeat recording and communication ability but still lacks analytical processing of the recorded data. An automatic heartbeat classification system can play as an analyzer and is still an open problem in the development stage. This paper proposes a heartbeat classifier based on RR interval data for real-time and continuous heartbeat monitoring using the Polar H10 wearable device. Several machine learning and deep learning methods were used to train the classifier. In the training process, we also compare intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms on the original and oversampling datasets to achieve higher classification accuracy and the fastest computation speed. As a result, with a constrain in RR interval data as the feature, the random forest-based classifier implemented in the system achieved up to 99.67\% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We are also conducting experiments involving healthy people to evaluate the classifier in a real-time monitoring system.},
