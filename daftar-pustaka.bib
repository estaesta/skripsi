  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been the golden standard for the detection of cardiovascular disease for many years. Any electrical impulse disruption that causes the heart to the contract may lead to arrhythmia. Arrhythmia patients have no indications of having an arrhythmia, but a doctor may recognize arrhythmias in a routine test. Therefore, continuous wearable personal monitoring system plays a big role, and it's become popular day by day. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system, Long Short-Term Memories neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, TensorFlow and Keras library are applied here. Those deep learning models and algorithms help to achieve overall 97.57\% accuracy on arrhythmia prediction. The system is being designed with Raspberry pi 3, Arduino UNO, AD8232 single lead ECG sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth, biomedical sensor pad and battery. This system will make easier for doctors to monitor the ECG of their patients outside the hospital and also help for remote ECG monitoring. The total components cost of this research work is around USD 58.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives . The electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to diagnose a variety of arrhythmias. Generally, the abnormalities of ECG signals mainly consist of ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies and irregular intervals. The ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies represent morphological information, while the irregular intervals denote the temporal information of ECG signals. But it is difficult to utilize morphological information and temporal information simultaneously when dealing with single ECG heartbeats, because RR interval is not contained in a single short heartbeat. Therefore, to handle this problems, a novel Multi-information Fusion Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (MF-CBRNN) is proposed for arrhythmia automatic detection. Methods . The MF-CBRNN is designed with two parallel hybrid branches that can simultaneously focus on the beat-based information in the ECG beats and the segment-based information in the adjacent segments of the beats. A single ECG beat provides the morphological information. At the same time, the adjacent segment of the ECG beat enriches the temporal information, so the two branches are designed to exploit the multiple information contained in ECGs. Furthermore, a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short memory (BLSTM) in each branch is utilized to capture the information from the two inputs. And all the features extracted from the two branches are fused for information aggregation. Results . To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the ECG signals from MIT-BIH databases are used for intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms. The proposed model yields an accuracy of 99.56\% and an F1-score of 96.40\% under the intra-patient paradigm. And it obtains an overall accuracy of 96.77\% and F1-score of 77.83\% under the inter-patient paradigm. Conclusions . Compared with other studies on arrhythmia detection, our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. It indicates that the proposed model is a promising arrhythmia detection algorithm for computer-aided diagnostic systems.},

A simple approach, based on the generally false assumption that the data are generated by a random walk, is nearly optimal.

  abstract = {An automatic system for heart arrhythmia classification can perform a substantial role in managing and treating cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a deep learning-based multi-model system is proposed for the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Two different deep learning bagging models are introduced to classify heartbeats into different arrhythmias types. The first model (CNN-LSTM) is based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture local features and temporal dynamics in the ECG data. The second model (RRHOS-LSTM) integrates some classical features, i.e. RR intervals and higher-order statistics (HOS), with LSTM model to effectively highlight abnormality heartbeats classes. We create a bagging model from the CNN-LSTM and RRHOS-LSTM networks by training each model on a different sub-sampling dataset to handle the high imbalance distribution of arrhythmias classes in the ECG data. Each model is also trained using a weighted loss function to provide high weight for not sufficiently represented classes. These models are then combined using a meta-classifier to form a strong coherent model. The meta-classifier is a feedforward fully connected neural network that takes the different predictions of bagging models as an input and combines them into a final prediction. The result of the meta-classifier is then verified by another CNN-LSTM model to decrease the false positive of the overall system. The experimental results are acquired by evaluating the proposed method on ECG data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 95.81\% in the ``subject-oriented'' patient independent evaluation scheme. The averages of F1 score and positive predictive value are higher than all other methods by more than 3\% and 8\% respectively. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method for ECG heartbeats classification compared to many state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The most important ECG marker for the diagnosis of ischemia or infarction is a change in the ST segment. Baseline wander is a typical artifact that corrupts the recorded ECG and can hinder the correct diagnosis of such diseases. For the purpose of finding the best suited filter for the removal of baseline wander, the ground truth about the ST change prior to the corrupting artifact and the subsequent filtering process is needed. In order to create the desired reference, we used a large simulation study that allowed us to represent the ischemic heart at a multiscale level from the cardiac myocyte to the surface ECG. We also created a realistic model of baseline wander to evaluate five filtering techniques commonly used in literature. In the simulation study, we included a total of 5.5 million signals coming from 765 electrophysiological setups. We found that the best performing method was the wavelet-based baseline cancellation. However, for medical applications, the Butterworth high-pass filter is the better choice because it is computationally cheap and almost as accurate. Even though all methods modify the ST segment up to some extent, they were all proved to be better than leaving baseline wander unfiltered.}

The method relies on the time intervals between consequent beats and their morphology for the ECG characterisation. Different descriptors based on wavelets, local binary patterns (LBP), higher order statistics (HOS) and several amplitude values were employed. Instead of concatenating all these features to feed a single SVM model, we propose to train specific SVM models for each type of feature. In order to obtain the final prediction, the decisions of the different models are combined with the product, sum, and majority rules. The designed methodology approaches are tested on the public MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, classifying four kinds of abnormal and normal beats. Our approach based on an ensemble of SVMs offered a satisfactory performance, improving the results when compared to a single SVM model using the same features. Additionally, our approach also showed better results in comparison with previous machine learning approaches of the state-of-the-art.},

When using a traditional monitoring system, an abnormal heartbeat may not appear during a recording in a healthcare facility due to the limited time. Thus, continuous and long-term monitoring is needed. Moreover, the conventional equipment may not be portable and cannot be used at arbitrary times and locations. A wearable sensor device such as Polar H10 offers the same capability as an alternative. It has gold-standard heartbeat recording and communication ability but still lacks analytical processing of the recorded data. An automatic heartbeat classification system can play as an analyzer and is still an open problem in the development stage. This paper proposes a heartbeat classifier based on RR interval data for real-time and continuous heartbeat monitoring using the Polar H10 wearable device. Several machine learning and deep learning methods were used to train the classifier. In the training process, we also compare intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms on the original and oversampling datasets to achieve higher classification accuracy and the fastest computation speed. As a result, with a constrain in RR interval data as the feature, the random forest-based classifier implemented in the system achieved up to 99.67\% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We are also conducting experiments involving healthy people to evaluate the classifier in a real-time monitoring system.},

	abstract = {The electrocardiogram (abbreviated as ECG or EKG) represents an electrical tracing of the heart and is recorded non-invasively from the surface of the body. The word ECG derives from the German language. In German, it is elektro-kardiographie. In 1902, the Dutch physician Einthovan invented ECG, and his tremendous input in clinical studies for about ten years led to full recognition of the clinical potential of the technique. Many arrhythmias and ECG changes associated with angina and atherosclerosis were identified by 1910. William Einthoven was named the "father of electrocardiography" and was awarded Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1924 for his hard work that laid the foundation of the most fundamental technique for investigating heart disorders. ECG was soon recognized as a robust screening and clinical diagnostic tool, and today it is used globally in almost every healthcare setting. ECG is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that has a substantial clinical impact on investigating the severity of cardiovascular diseases. ECG is increasingly being used for monitoring patients on antiarrhythmics and other drugs, as an integral part of preoperative assessment of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and for screening individuals in high-risk occupations and those participating in sports. Also, ECG serves as a research tool for surveillance and experimental trials of drugs with recognized cardiac effects. Cardiovascular disease, as the number one cause of death, puts a great emphasis on healthcare providers developing skills and knowledge in interpreting ECGs to provide the best care promptly. Many healthcare providers find the advanced interpretation of ECG findings a complicated task. Errors in the analysis can lead to misdiagnosis, delaying the appropriate treatment. This activity seeks to provide a general understanding of the ECG mechanisms, interpretation techniques, and commonly encountered ECG findings.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CDVs) remain a leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, the disease needs to be detected as early as possible. One of the solutions is using an automated ECG Signal prediction using machine learning or deep learning. Among the many techniques in automated ECG signal analysis, wavelet transform has been highlighted due to its effectiveness in denoising and feature extraction. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is performed to predict the heartbeat. In the group of many techniques in wavelet transform, it is necessary to find out which is better in heartbeat prediction not only to be trained and tested with a secondary dataset but also with a primary or real dataset of ECG signal. In this paper, we compare the wavelet transform techniques, such as Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), and also do inferencing. Those techniques were trained and tested by MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. As a result, the highest test accuracy is achieved by CWT with 0.9908 accuracy. Then, by testing it with a 30-minute recording of the ECG signal, the shortest time in inferencing is achieved by DWT in 12.92 seconds. It also used the lowest memory with 109.98 MB and SWT achieved the lowest CPU usage in inferencing with 26.34\%.},

	abstract = {Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), causing million deaths every year. Moreover it is difficult to diagnose because it occurs intermittently and as such requires the analysis of large amount of data, collected during the daily life of patients. An important tool for CVD diagnosis is the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG), because of its non-invasive nature and simplicity of acquisition. In this work we propose a classification algorithm for arrhythmia based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that operate directly on ECG data, exploring the effectiveness and efficiency of several variations of the general RNN, in particular using different types of layers implementing the network memory. We use the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the evaluation protocol recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). After designing and testing the effectiveness of the different networks, we then test its porting to an embedded platform, namely the STM32 microcontroller architecture from ST, using a specific framework to port a pre-built RNN to the embedded hardware, convert it to optimized code for the platform and evaluate its performance in terms of resource usage. Both in binary and multiclass classification, the basic RNN model outperforms the other architectures in terms of memory storage (∼117 KB), number of parameters (∼5 k) and inference time (∼150 ms), while the RNN LSTM-based achieved the best accuracy (∼90\%).},

	abstract = {In this paper, an on-device classification of electrocardiography (ECG) with Compressed Learning (CL) for health Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed. A CL algorithm combining with one-dimensional (1-D) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that directly learns on ECG signals in the compression domain without expanded normalization is proposed. Such an approach bypasses the reconstruction step and minimizes the raw input data dimension that significantly reduces the processing power. An automatic network optimization framework with Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) tool Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) is suggested to adapt to the network structure search problem introduced by input dimension reduction with Compression Ratios (CRs). That ensures the minimized model size and operation number under a guaranteed classification accuracy. To implement the resized 1-D CL classifier in hardware, which has different kernel sizes, strides, and output channels under different CRs, a flexible architecture is proposed to further lower power consumption. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH database, the specific 1-D CNN network selected under CR =0.2 achieves a Macro-F1 of 0.9214 on 5-class ECG signal classification, with a 6.4× reduction in FLOPs and a 2.6× decrease in model size with an only 0.028 loss in Macro-F1 compared with the uncompressed situation. Synthesized in UMC 40 nm Low Power process, the hardware architecture with the 1-D CL classifier achieves an energy efficiency of 0.83 μJ/Classification under a 1.1-V power supply at a frequency of 5 MHz.},

Deep-learning based algorithms provide significantly better performances than traditional algorithms in many fields but demand more resources, such as higher computational power and more memory. Hence, designing deep learning algorithms that are more suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices is vital. In this paper, we build a lightweight neural network, termed LiteNet which uses a deep learning algorithm design to diagnose arrhythmias, as an example to show how we design deep learning schemes for resource-constrained mobile devices. Compare to other deep learning models with an equivalent accuracy, LiteNet has several advantages. It requires less memory, incurs lower computational cost, and is more feasible for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. It can be trained faster than other neural network algorithms and requires less communication across different processing units during distributed training. It uses filters of heterogeneous size in a convolutional layer, which contributes to the generation of various feature maps. The algorithm was tested using the MIT-BIH electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia database; the results showed that LiteNet outperforms comparable schemes in diagnosing arrhythmias, and in its feasibility for use at the mobile devices.},

As health care and health insurance costs increase in the world, the direct impact of this work is saving lives and improving medical care.
